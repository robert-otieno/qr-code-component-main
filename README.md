## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learnt how to create responsive images in css and how to use calc() to calculate the height of an element.

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

.qr-code {
    min-height: calc(100vh - 14px);
}
```

### Continued development

I believe adding animations to the project will be super nice!

### Useful resources
